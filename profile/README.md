## 🧬 What is Synapse?

Synapse is an experimental tool designed to unravel and illuminate the complex tapestry of connections that exist across a myriad of subjects. It's a platform where data isn't just stored – it's contextualized, connected, and made meaningful. Synapse merges diverse data sources into an intricate graph-based model, shining a light on the hidden links in projects, professional fields, academic subjects, and more. It's where data transforms into insights.

## 🌟 Why Synapse?

We believe in the power of connection – in data and in people. Synapse is for those who seek clarity in complexity.
